# Observatory-DB-with-Java-APP

Final project for the Databases course. There is a complete and operational SQL database which provides storage for information collected in an application based in an observatory. It contains some sample data and an image of its structure. There is also a basic Java APP which is connected to the DB, separated in different layers.
